# Scrabble Solver
by: Alvin Tu

## Overview

This is a take on a project I did in one of my computer science classes. Once this program runs, you are able to type a series of letters, just like in scrabble.
After, the program will output all possible word combinations with the given letters in order of greatest points to lowest points. This project was originally desgined
for a fun way to beat my friends in scrabble!

## How it Scrabbles!

Scrabble solver creates a dictionary of words with associated points. To see the potential words, the program first reads in a file of words into a list. 
Then, the program checks the inputted letters with the list of words to see what words could be created. Once we have a list of potential words, the scrabble solver
then looks for the letters and gives the word its associated points. Finally, the program will print out all of the words and their points. Now you have the means to never 
lose at scrabble!
